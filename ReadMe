In this game, Reinforcement Learning Algorithms are used to drive a virtual mouse 
to move around in a 2D world environment and avoid all the pitfalls that will be presented to it,
gathering small pieces of cheese in order to discover the exit. 
To create the game, the Unity Game Engine was used and a Markov Decision Process (MDP) was implemented. 
The programming language chosen is C#, in which the Qlearning and SARSA algorithms
have been implemented.

Game Engine: Unity3D

Programming Language: C#
